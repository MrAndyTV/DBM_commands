# DBM_commands

Hey, These commands is free for everyone to use!

How can I add this to my Discord Bot Maker Program?

1. Open the files and copy the ones you want.
2. Open DBM > Create Command > Right Click the command > Edit Raw Data > Delete everthing in that file > Then paste what you copied into that file.
3. Then redo for each command.
